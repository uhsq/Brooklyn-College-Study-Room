## Wireframe
This project draws heavy inspiration from the UB Study Room Reservation system because of the personal connections I have. These connections helped me understand key features and user needs, guiding what elements should be prioritized in the design. I used Figma to create the wireframes, ensuring a user-friendly and simple interface.
Here are some of the wireframes for the project:
